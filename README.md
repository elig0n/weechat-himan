# Hi, man! What are they saying about you?
Log highlights to a private buffer while /away (or not!)

Hi, man! relies on WeeChat's weechat.look.highlight option, so as long as you have a highlight word(s) defined, you're good to start using Hi, man!

I wrote this because my good pal narcolept wanted a highmon.pl that looked good with fUrlbuf (https://github.com/px-havok/weechat-furlbuf) but without all the extras.
